                            <strong>What is solar? </strong><br>
                            Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of
                            technologies such as solar power to generate electricity, solar thermal energy including
                            solar water heating, and solar architecture. <br> <br>
                            It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized
                            as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy
                            or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems,
                            concentrated solar power, and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques
                            include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favourable thermal mass or
                            light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
                            <br> <br>
                            At KayaBona we use mostly passive solar technologies to craft solutions specific to you. 
                            To this end we have partnered with some leading suppliers in the solar market to bring the right solution to you at the right price.
